# Config to install all rust dependencies from "vendor" directory created when
# `cargo vendor` is run. During development we don't want to vendor rust
# dependencies and just let cargo download and install them for us, but when
# generating release artifacts rust dependencies must be vendored as they can't
# be downloaded from inside the opam sandbox. The github action that runs when a
# tag is pushed will vendor dependencies and rename this file to "config.toml".
